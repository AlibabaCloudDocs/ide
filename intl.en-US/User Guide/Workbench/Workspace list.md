    -   Basic configuration
        -   Workspace name: The workspace name must be 3 to 27 characters in length.
        -   Display name: The display name must be 27 characters in length.
    -   Advanced configuration
        -   Enable scheduling frequency: Controls whether to enable the scheduling system in the current workspace. If the scheduling frequency is disabled, it cannot periodically schedule tasks.
        -   Enable select result downloads in this workspace: When this configuration is enabled, data results from select statement can be downloaded in this workspace. When this configuration is disabled, it cannot download the data query results from select statement.
    -   MaxCompute configuration
        -   Development Environment MaxCompute Workspace name: The default name is the workspace name + "\_ dev" suffix, which can be modified.
        -   Development Environment MaxCompute access identity: The default is a personal account.
        -   Production Environment MaxCompute Workspace name: The default name is the same as the DataWorks workspace.
        -   Development Environment MaxCompute access identity: The default access identity is the production account. We recommend you do not change the default setting.
        -   Quota group: Quota is used to implement disk quotas.

When the workspace is created successfully, the Workspace List displays the corresponding content.

-   Workspace status: The workspace is typically classified into five states: normal, initialization, initialization failure, deleting and deleted. Creating a workspace initially displays an initialized state, and then generally shows the results of initialization failure or normal.

    After the workspace is created successfully, you can perform disable and delete. After the workspace is disabled, you can also activate and delete the workspace. The workspace is normal after it is activated.

-   Subscribe to a service: Your mouse moves on to the service, and all the opened services are displayed. Generally, the normal service icon display is blue, while the outstanding payment service icon is red. If the outstanding payment service has been deleted, it is displayed as gray, and the outstanding payment service is automatically deleted after 7 days.

**Note:** 

-   Once you become a workspace owner, it means you have full ownership over the workspace, and anyone that wants to access the workspace must apply for permission.
-   For general users, you do not have to create a workspace. If you have been added to a workspace, you can use MaxCompute.
