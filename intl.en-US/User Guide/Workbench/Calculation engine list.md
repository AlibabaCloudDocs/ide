-   MaxCompute currently supports two billing methods: **Pay-As-You-Go** and **Subscription**. **Renew Management** will be displayed under the activated billing method, while **Open Immediately** will be shown under the unactivated billing style.
-   **Opening list**: You can search by project space name. The project space list displays basic information about the project space.

    You can **Change the Quota Group** for the subscription project space, and click **Change the Quota group** to go to the MaxCompute Manager page. If you did not subscribe, you will be prompted that **You have unsubscribed resources**.
