# Configure RDBMS Writer {#concept_e12_jyt_q2b .concept}

The RDBMS Writer plug-in provides the ability to write data into the target table of the master RDBMS database. At the underlying implementation level, RDBMS Writer connects to a remote RDBMS database through JDBC, and runs the insert into ...  to write data into RDBMS. RDBMS Writer is a relational database write plug-in for generic purposes, allowing you to add any relational database write support by registering database drivers or other methods.

RDBMS Writer is designed for ETL developers to import data from data warehouses to RDBMS. RDBMS Writer can also be used as a data migration tool by DBA and other users.

## Implementation principles {#section_f12_jyt_q2b .section}

RDBMS Writer uses the DataX framework to get the protocol data generated by Reader. Then it connects to a remote RDBMS database through JDBC, and runs the insert into ... to write data into RDBMS.

Configuration sample

-   Configure a job for writing data into RDBMS.

Parameter description

-   jdbcUrl
    -   Description: Information of the JDBC connection to the opposite-end database. The format of jdbcUrl is in accordance with the RDBMS official specification, and the URL attachment control information can be entered. Note that JDBC formats vary with databases and DataX selects an appropriate database driver for data reading based on a specific JDBC format.
        -   DM: jdbc:dm://ip:port/database
        -   DB2 format: jdbc:db2://ip:port/database
        -   PPAS format: jdbc:edb://ip:port/database

How to add database support using RDBMS Writer:

-   Enter the corresponding directory of RDBMS Writer. $\{DATAX\_HOME\} is the main directory of DataX, that is, $\{DATAX\_HOME\}/plugin/writer/RDBMS Writer.
-   Find the plugin.json file under the directory of RDBMS Writer and register your database driver into the file \(keep the database driver in the drivers array\). RDBMS Writer dynamically selects an appropriate database driver to connect the database during task execution.

```
{
    "name": "RDBMS Writer",
    "class":"com.alibaba.datax.plugin.reader.RDBMS Writer.RDBMS Writer",
    "description": "useScene: prod. mechanism: Jdbc connection using the database, execute select sql, retrieve data from the ResultSet. warn: The more you know about the database, the less problems you encounter.",
    "developer": "alibaba",
    "Drivers ":[
        "dm.jdbc.driver.DmDriver",

        "com.sybase.jdbc3.jdbc.SybDriver",
        "com.edb.Driver"
    ]
}
```

-   Find the libs subdirectory under the directory of RDBMS Writer and keep your database driver in the libs subdirectory.

|:--------|:----------|:-------|:------------|
|username|Data Source User Name|Yes|None |
|password|Description: Password corresponding to the specified username for the data source.|Yes|None|
|table|Description: Target table name. If the schema information of table is not consistent with the username in the preceding configuration, enter the table information in the schema.table format.|Yes|None|
|column|Description: The column name set to be synchronized in the configured table. separated by commas \(,\). `We strongly recommend against the default column configuration. `|Yes|None|
|Presql|Description: The SQL statement that is run before the data synchronization task is run. Currently, you can run only one SQL statement, for example, clear old data.|No|None|
|Postsql|Description: The SQL statement that is run before the data synchronization task is run. Currently, you can run only one SQL statement, for example, add a timestamp.|No|None|
|batchSize|Description: The quantity of records submitted in one operation. Setting this parameter can greatly reduce the interactions between DataX and RDBMS over the network, and increase the overall throughput.

## Type conversion {#section_yt2_cn5_q2b .section}

RDBMSReader supports most generic rational database types such as numbers and characters. Check whether your data type is supported and select a reader based on a specific database.
