# Add security group {#concept_ec4_cj5_q2b .concept}

This article describes how to add a corresponding security group when you are using DataWorks \(formerly Data IDE\) in different regions.

To ascertain the security and stability of databases, you must add the IP addresses or IP segments used for accessing the database to the [Add a whitelist](intl.en-US/User Guide/Data Integration/Common configuration/Add whitelist.md#) or security group of the target instance before using certain database instances.

## Add a security group {#section_djc_kj5_q2b .section}

-   If the self-built data source synchronization tasks on your ECS run on a custom resource group, you must authorize the machine of that custom resource group by adding the private/public IP and port of the custom machine to the ECS security group.
-   If the self-built data source on your ECs runs on the default Resource Group, to give default machine authorization, choose to add your security group content based on your ECs machine region, for example, your ECs is North China 2, and the security group adds North China 2 \(Beijing \): 2ze3236e8pcbxw61o9y0 and 1156529087455811 content, as shown in the following table.

    |Region|Authorization object|Account ID|
    |:-----|:-------------------|:---------|
    |China \(Hangzhou\)|sg-bp13y8iuj33uqpqvgqw2|1156529087455811|
    |China \(Shanghai\)|sg-uf6ir5g3rlu7thymywza|1156529087455811|
    |China \(Shenzhen\)|sg-wz9ar9o9jgok5tajj7ll|1156529087455811|
    |Singapore|sg-t4n222njci99ik5y6dag|1156529087455811|
    |Hong Kong|Sg-j6c28uqpqb27yc3tjmb6|1156529087455811|
    |US \(Silicon Valley\)|sg-rj9bowpmdvhyl53lza2j|1156529087455811|
    |China \(Beijing\)|sg-2ze3236e8pcbxw61o9y0|1156529087455811|

    **Note:** The ECS of the VPC environment does not support adding the above security groups.
