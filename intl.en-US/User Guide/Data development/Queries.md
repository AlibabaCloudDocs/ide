# Queries {#concept_lfk_lzf_q2b .concept}

Temporary query facilitates you to use the editing code, test whether the actual conditions of the local code meets the expectations, and check the code status. Therefore, temporary query does not support submitting, releasing, and setting the scheduling parameters. To use the scheduling parameters, create a node in Data development or Manual business flow.
