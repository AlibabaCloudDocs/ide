## Scenarios {#section_wq8_4wt_xrh .section}

You can clone nodes across workspaces in the following scenarios:

-   Clone nodes from a basic workspace to a standard workspace.

## Procedure {#section_svy_l1v_9t6 .section}

1.  Create a workflow on the Data Analytics page.
2.  Click **Cross-project cloning** in the upper-right corner. On the Create Clone Task page that appears, select a target workspace. Search for nodes to be cloned, and click Add to List in the Actions column of each node that is found.
3.  Click **To-Be-Cloned Node List**. In the right pane that appears, click Clone All.
4.  View the clone results in the target workspace. The directory tree of each node is cloned, including the workflow.
