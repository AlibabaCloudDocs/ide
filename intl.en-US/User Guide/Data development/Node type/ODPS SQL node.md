# ODPS SQL node {#concept_cc4_1x3_p2b .concept}

This topic describes the ODPS SQL node functions. The ODPS SQL node syntax is similar to SQL, and is suited for distributed scenario with massive data volume at the TB-level, but has low real-time requirements. The ODPS SQL node is an OLAP application oriented throughput. We recommend you use ODPS SQL if your business needs to handle tens of thousands transactions because it requires a long period to complete the job process from preparation to submission.
