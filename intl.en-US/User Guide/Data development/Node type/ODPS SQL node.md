# ODPS SQL node {#concept_cc4_1x3_p2b .concept}

ODPS SQL adopts the syntax similar to that of SQL, and is applicable to the distributed scenario in which the amount of data is massive \(TB-level\) but the real-time requirement is not high. It is an OLAP application oriented to throughput. Because it takes a long time to complete the process from preparation to submission of a job, ODPS SQL is recommended if a business needs to handle tens of thousands of transactions.

1.  Create a business flow.

    Right-click **Business Flow** under **Data Development**, select **Create Business Flow**.

4.  Query result display

    DataWorks query results are connected to the spreadsheet function, making it easier for users to operate on data results.

    The query results are displayed directly in the style of a spreadsheet. Users can perform operations in DataWorks, open them in a spreadsheet, or freely copy content stations in local excels.
