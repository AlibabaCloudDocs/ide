# Virtual node {#concept_iqn_dfq_p2b .concept}

A virtual node is a control node that does not generate any data. Generally, it is used as the root node for overall planning of nodes in the workflow.

**Note:** The final output table of a workflow contains multiple branch input tables. Virtual nodes are usually used if these input tables do not have dependency between them.
