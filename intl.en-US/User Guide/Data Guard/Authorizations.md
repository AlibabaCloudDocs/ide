# Authorizations {#concept_ljz_4zk_qgb .concept}

On the Authorizations page, a project administrator can view the accounts that have permissions on tables and fields in each workspace, and revoke unnecessary table and field permissions.

Log on to Data Guard. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Authorizations**. The **Table** tab appears.

On this tab, you can select a workspace and specify the environment \(for a workspace in standard mode\) to view all the tables of the workspace in the specified environment. You can also enter a table name in the search box to search for required tables in fuzzy match mode.
