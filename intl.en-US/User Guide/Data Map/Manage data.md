# Manage data {#concept_266056 .concept}

This topic describes how to use **My Tables** of Data Map to manage your data.

## Owned by Me and Managed by Me as Workspace Administrator {#section_6uh_f1o_4n9 .section}

Both the **Owned by Me** and **Managed by Me as Workspace Administrator** pages provide the search feature. You can search for data based on the table name, project or database, and visible range.

|**Table Name**|The name of the table. You can click a table name to go to the details page of the table.|
|**Display Name**|The display name of the table. You can click the icon next to a display name to modify it.|
|**Project/Data Store**|The project or database of the table. Tables have different suffixes when they are deployed in different environments. For example, **\_dev** indicates the development environment.|
