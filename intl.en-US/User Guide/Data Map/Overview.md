Data Map allows you to search for data globally, use a personal account to manage data, or manage configurations as an administrator.

In the DataWorks console, click the menu button in the upper-left corner of the top navigation bar and choose **All Products** \> **Data Map**. The Data Map page appears.

-   If you prefer a powerful search engine, click **Data Map** in the upper-left corner of the top navigation bar to go to the homepage for searching.
-   If you would like to search for tables by category, click **All Categories**. Tables are displayed by category. The number of tables in each category is also displayed.
-   If you need to handle personal data, such as modifying your tables or using tools, click **My Tables**.
-   If you are a category administrator or workspace administrator and need to modify the workspace configuration or global categories, click **Settings**.

Currently, if you enter keywords for searching, the search results are more accurate. Data Map also supports other search objects. For example, you can search for a workspace to join. If you use Data Map frequently, you can directly select tables in the **Recently Viewed Tables** and **Recently Read Tables** sections. You can also select tables in the **Most Read Tables** and **Most Viewed Tables** sections. These tables are recommended based on your access records.
