# Access analysis {#concept_h3f_zr3_r2b .concept}

Data access includes both access behavior and export behavior.

-   Access analysis: Contains create, insert operations, but does not include access failed behavior.
-   Export analysis: the behavior that the data exports from MaxCompute.

## Access analysis {#section_x4h_fw3_r2b .section}

After the data security administrator completes the sensitive data rule configuration T + 1, you can view data usage in the data access behavior, includes overview of access, access trends, and access details.

Depending on your query needs, by project, rule name, rule type, risk level \(that is, grading\), visitors, etc. for filtering selection.

## Export analysis {#section_g4f_tw3_r2b .section}

After the data security administrator completes the sensitive data rule configuration T+1, you can see in the data export how the user exports the data from MaxCompute to the outside, includes total data export, top export users, and export details.

Depending on your query needs, filter your selections by rule name, rule type, export quantity, and so on.
