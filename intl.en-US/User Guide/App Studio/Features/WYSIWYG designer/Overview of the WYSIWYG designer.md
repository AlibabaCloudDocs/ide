# Overview of the WYSIWYG designer {#concept_rnw_vl2_v2b .concept}

The WYSIWYG designer of App Studio is a tool provided to assist in developing frontend pages. It provides common webpage components that allow you to create frontend pages by simple drag-and-drop operations. This topic describes the features of the WYSIWYG designer.

## Use a compatible framework {#section_ir4_hn1_dhb .section}

The WYSIWYG designer is compatible with React, Angular, and Vue because it uses a common description language to describe the properties such as structures, appearances, and actions of pages at the underlying layer.

## Integrate a simple data processing method to meet complex interaction needs {#section_z3c_zn1_dhb .section}

App Studio integrates a global state management solution to manage page data and associate components.

## Provide the code mode to build complex interactive pages {#section_hlc_m41_dhb .section}

The WYSIWYG designer uses the common structured description language domain-specific language \(DSL\) at the intermediate layer to switch between the visualized drag-and-drop mode and code mode. You can directly edit the code based on DSL. This feature brings the advanced user experience for high-end developers.

## Visually configure component association {#section_lxc_1p1_dhb .section}

The WYSIWYG designer allows you to visually link parameters of components to associate them.

## Publish and run pages without building {#section_d5k_wp1_dhb .section}

App Studio compiles the intermediate DSL code online into the code that can be directly run in the browser for page rendering.

## Connect to DataService Studio of DataWorks and quickly integrate data APIs {#section_fp2_zp1_dhb .section}

App Studio seamlessly connects to DataService Studio APIs of DataWorks, allowing you to debug the APIs in real time.

## Provide abundant components and templates {#section_t1x_1q1_dhb .section}

App Studio provides abundant components. You can also customize components and upload them to the component library.

In addition, App Studio provides abundant templates. You can quickly create a page based on a template. You can also save the created page as a template and publish it to the template market for use by others.
