## Use cases {#section_fdp_bbd_r2b .section}

-   The Operation Center is a place where tasks and instances are displayed and operated. You can view all your tasks in the Task List and perform such operations on the displayed tasks as testing tasks and completing data.
-   Â In Task Maintenance, you can view the instances of all your tasks and terminate, re-run, or unfreeze the displayed instances.

**Note:** An instance is generated when a task in the scheduling system is triggered by the system or manually. An instance is a snapshot of a task at a certain time point, which includes the running time, status, and log of the task.
