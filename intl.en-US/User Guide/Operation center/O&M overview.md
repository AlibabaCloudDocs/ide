## Task completion status {#section_bsh_5bd_r2b .section}

This module compares and generates statistical data for the completion of normal cyclic scheduling tasks for today, yesterday, and an average history level. If sharp misalignments occur between the three curves, it indicates exceptions within a certain period of time, and further checks and analyses are required as a result.

As shown in the above line statistics, three different color lines are displayed on the same day ~ Statistics on progress in the completion of all types of tasks in the current project space during the period of 24: 00, including today's completion of the task, yesterday's completion of the task and the history of the average level of completion. You can click the status statistics boxes on top of the line graph to jump to the corresponding task pages and view the task details under the current status.
