# O&M overview {#concept_cvw_l2t_q2b .concept}

## Task completion status {#section_bsh_5bd_r2b .section}

This module compares and generates statistical data for the completion of normal cyclic scheduling tasks for today, yesterday, and an average history level. If sharp misalignments occur between the three curves, it indicates exceptions within a certain period of time, and further checks and analyses are required as a result.

As shown in the above line statistics, three different color lines are displayed on the same day ~ Statistics on progress in the completion of all types of tasks in the current project space during the period of 24: 00, including today's completion of the task, yesterday's completion of the task and the history of the average level of completion.

## Task running status {#section_q5g_wdd_r2b .section}

This section displays the number of currently running tasks by time. You can view the peak number of concurrent tasks at a certain point in time, and adjust the scheduled running time to avoid the concurrency peak.

## Ranking of running durations of tasks {#section_pvf_x2d_r2b .section}

This section displays the ranking of running durations of tasks within the business period in the current project space. By default, the top ten tasks are displayed in descending order. The name, owner, and running duration of the task are displayed.

The tasks are displayed by business date. You can switch the business date to view the ranking of other dates.

## Ranking of failures in the last month {#section_lcm_n3g_r2b .section}

This section displays the top ten tasks with errors in the last month in descending order . You can view the task name, the owner and the occurrence of errors.

You can click a task name to jump to the details page of the task error history.

## Trend in the number of scheduling tasks {#section_c1z_4jg_r2b .section}

This section displays the total number of current tasks and the task count changes compared with yesterday, last week, and last month. as shown in the following figure.
