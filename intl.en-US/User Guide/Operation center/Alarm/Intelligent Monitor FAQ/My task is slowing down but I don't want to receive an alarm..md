# My task is slowing down but I don't want to receive an alarm. {#concept_qjk_zxs_42b .concept}

The following conditions must be met before an alarm is reported for task slowdown:Â 

-   The task is on the upstream node of an important baseline.
-   The task becomes slow in comparison with its previous running behavior.

If the task slowdown is insignificant, you can ignore it and check with the downstream baseline that has monitored tasks \(downstream baseline information is displayed on the **Event Management** page\). If the downstream baseline is affected, maintain the task properly.
