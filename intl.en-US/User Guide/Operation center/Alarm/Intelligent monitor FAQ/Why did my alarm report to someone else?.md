# Why did my alarm report to someone else? {#concept_ec1_hws_42b .concept}

-   Check with custom notification creators about rules of custom alarms.
-   For alarms generated by baselines with the baseline function enabled, check the specific event page, on which the alarm transmission cause is provided in the lower part.
-   If the project of a task is associated with a duty schedule, an alarm is sent to the recipient specified in the duty schedule first. If no duty schedule is available, Alarm checks whether a person has an associated duty schedule. If no, Alarm sends the alarm to the task owner.
