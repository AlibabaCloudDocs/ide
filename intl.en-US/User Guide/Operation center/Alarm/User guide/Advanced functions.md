Intelligent Monitor allows you to configure advanced functions on the **Alarm Configuration** and **Management** pages, on which you can set whether to report an alarm, alarm method, and alarm object.

## Alarm configuration {#section_kb3_rf4_42b .section}

Click **Alarm Configuration**, you can set whether to receive alarms by phone. The setting of this item delivers great influence, it can be set once only every two weeks, to prevent casual and informal handling of alarms. Set the alarm language to Chinese or English and click **Submit** for the settings to take effect, as shown in the following figure.

## Management {#section_btz_gg4_42b .section}

Enter the **Management** \> **Application** page, select a duty schedule for the application \(project\) as well as the alarm escalation recipient.

Select **Management** \> **Baseline** , set the alarm object to a person or duty schedule for a baseline and whether to enable the baseline warning function. An alarm is reported in the baseline warning or breakage state only after the baseline warning function is enabled.
