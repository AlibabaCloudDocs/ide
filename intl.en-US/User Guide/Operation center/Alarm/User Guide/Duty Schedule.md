# Duty Schedule {#concept_yzf_gh4_42b .concept}

On the **Duty Schedule** page, select a duty schedule to be edited from the left-side menu and click a date box on the right side to edit the duty schedule.

In the displayed edit box, select the on-duty operator, effective date, priority, and whether the duty schedule is cycled.

-   Priority: Priority is a relative concept. A higher priority indicates that an alarm is reported preferentially. If an alarm is not handled for a long time, an alarm is reported for the task and person.Â 
-   Cycle rule: If cycle is not selected, the duty schedule indicates a one-time schedule. If cycle is selected, the number of days in cycle needs to be set. The number of days in cycle indicates the interval between the start of one cycle to the start of the next cycle and is independent of the end time.
