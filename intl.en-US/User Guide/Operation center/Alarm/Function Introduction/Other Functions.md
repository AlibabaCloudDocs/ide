## Duty schedule function {#section_gkp_jzn_42b .section}

Alarm provides the duty schedule function. Like the calendar function, the duty schedule function allows you to set a duty schedule and specify a person to receive alerts within a period of time. The duty schedule takes effect only after it is configured as an object for receiving alerts in the alert policy. The duty schedule function supports the cycle rule configuration and the active/standby mode.
