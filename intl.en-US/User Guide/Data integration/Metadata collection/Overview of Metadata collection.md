# Overview of Metadata collection {#concept_dh1_dwg_mfb .concept}

Metadata collection means that metadata is collected periodically into the system, and quickly pulls the relevant table and field information through Wizard Mode.

You can operate Metadata collection in Data Source Management page **New Collection task** and **Managing Collection tasks**with data source type **Without public network IP address**.

**Note:** 

-   Currently, without public network IP address database \(MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL\) metadata \(database table information, field information\) is supported only. Especially, Metadata add function is only supported in East China 2.
-   Only the project administrators have read access permission for the relevant metadata collection entry.
-   A data source allows only one metadata collection task.
