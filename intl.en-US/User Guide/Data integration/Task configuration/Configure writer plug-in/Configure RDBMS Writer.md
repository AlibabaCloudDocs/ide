# Configure RDBMS Writer {#concept_e12_jyt_q2b .concept}

This topic describes the data types and parameters supported by the RDBMS Writer.

The RDBMS Writer plug-in provides the capability to write data into the target table of the master RDBMS database. At the underlying implementation level, the RDBMS Writer connects to a remote RDBMS database through JDBC, and runs the SQL statement insert into...to write data into RDBMS. The RDBMS Writer is a relational database write plug-in for generic purposes, allowing you to add any relational database write support by registering database drivers or other methods.

RDBMS Writer is designed for Extract, transform, load \(ETL\) developers to import data from data warehouses to RDBMS. The RDBMS Writer can also be used as a data migration tool by DBA and other users.

## Implementation principles {#section_f12_jyt_q2b .section}

RDBMS Writer uses the DataX framework to obtain the protocol data generated by the Reader. Then it connects to a remote RDBMS database through JDBC, and runs the SQL statement insert into... to write data into RDBMS.

Configuration sample

-   Configure a job for writing data into RDBMS as follows.

Parameter description

-   jdbcUrl
    -   Description: The JDBC connection information of the opposite-end database. The jdbcUrl format is based on the RDBMS official specification, which allows you to enter the URL attachment control information. Note that databases have different JDBC formats, and DataX selects the appropriate database driver for data reading based on a specific JDBC format.
        -   DM: jdbc:dm://ip:port/database
        -   DB2 format: jdbc:db2://ip:port/database
        -   PPAS format: jdbc:edb://ip:port/database

How to add database support using RDBMS Writer:

-   Enter the corresponding directory of the RDBMS Writer. This $\{DATAX\_HOME\} is the main directory of DataX, that is, $\{DATAX\_HOME\}/plugin/writer/RDBMS Writer.
-   Go to the plugin.json file under the RDBMS Writer directory and register your database driver into the file, which will keep the database driver in the drivers array. The RDBMS Writer plug-in will dynamically select an appropriate database driver to connect the database during task execution.

```
{
    "name": "RDBMS Writer",
    "class":"com.alibaba.datax.plugin.reader.RDBMS Writer.RDBMS Writer",
    "description": "useScene: prod. mechanism: Jdbc connection using the database, execute select sql, retrieve data from the ResultSet. warn: The more you know about the database, the less problems you encounter.",
    "developer": "alibaba",
    "Drivers ":[
        "dm.jdbc.driver.DmDriver",
        "com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver",
        "com.sybase.jdbc3.jdbc.SybDriver",
        "com.edb.Driver"
    ]
}
```

-   Go to libs subdirectory under the directory of RDBMS Writer and keep your database driver in the libs subdirectory.

    -   Required: Yes
    -   By default, this field is not specified.

|Parameters|Description|Required|Default value|
|:---------|:----------|:-------|:------------|
|username|The data source user name.|Yes|None |
|password|The password corresponding to the specified user name for the data source.|Yes|None|
|table|The target table name. If the table schema information is inconsistent with the user name in the preceding configuration, enter the table information in the schema.table format.|Yes|None|
|column|The column name set to be synchronized in the configured table is separated by commas \(,\). `We strongly do not recommend you use the default column configuration. `|Yes|None|
|PreSQL|The SQL statement that runs before the data synchronization task run. Currently, you can run only one SQL statement. For example: clear old data.|No|None|
|PostSQL|The SQL statement that runs before the data synchronization task run. Currently, you can run only one SQL statement. For example: add a timestamp.|No|None|
|batchSize|The number of records submitted in one operation. Setting this parameter can greatly reduce interaction between DataX and RDBMS over the network, and increase the overall throughput. However, an excessively large value may cause the running process of DataX to become Out of Memory \(OOM\).|No|1024|

## Type conversion {#section_yt2_cn5_q2b .section}

RDBMS Reader supports most generic relational database types, such as numbers and characters. Check whether the data type is supported and select a reader based on the specified database.
