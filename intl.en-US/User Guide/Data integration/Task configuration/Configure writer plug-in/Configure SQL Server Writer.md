# Configure SQL Server Writer {#concept_sdt_fb4_q2b .concept}

This topic describes the data types and parameters supported by SQL Server Writer and how to configure Writer in both wizard and script mode.

The SQL Server Writer plug-in can be used to write data in target tables of the primary SQL Server database. At the underlying implementation level, the SQL Server Writer connects to a remote SQL Server database through JDBC, and runs the `insert into...` to write data in an SQL Server instance. Data is submitted to the database in batch within the instance.

The SQL Server Writer is designed for ETL developers to import data from data warehouses to the SQL Server. The SQL Server Writer can also be used as a data migration tool by DBA and other users.

The SQL Server Writer obtains protocol data \(`insert into...`\) generated by Reader through the Data Integration framework. If the primary key conflicts with the unique index, the data cannot be written in conflicting lines. To improve performance, use `PreparedStatement + Batch` and configure `rewriteBatchedStatements=true` to buffer data to the thread context buffer. Write requests are initiated only when the amount of data in the buffer reaches the threshold.

**Note:** 

-   Data can be written into a target table only when the target table resides in the primary database.
-   The task should at least have the insert into... permission. Whether other permissions are required depends on the statements specified in PreSQL and PostSQL when you configure the task.

## Type conversion list {#section_vcg_fvn_q2b .section}

The SQL Server Writer supports most data types in the SQL Server. Check whether your data type is supported before using it.

The SQL Server writer converts the list of types for SQL Server, as shown below.

|Type classification|SQL server data types|
|:------------------|:--------------------|
|Integer| Bigint, Int, Smallint, and Tinyint

 |
|Float point|Float, decimal, real numeric|
|String type| char, nchar, ntext, nvarchar, text, varchar, nvarchar \(MAX\), and varchar \(MAX\)

 |
|Date and time type|Date, time, and datetime|
|Boolean|Bit|
|Binary|Binary, varbinary, varbinary \(max\), and timestamp|

## Parameter description​ {#section_jn2_gqh_p2b .section}

|Attribute|Description|Required|Default Value|
|:--------|:----------|:-------|:------------|
|datasource|The data source name. It must be identical to the data source name added. Adding data source is supported in script mode.|Yes|None|
|table|The name of the selected table that needs to be synchronized.|Yes|None|
|column|The fields of the target table into which data is required to be written. These fields are separated by commas. For example, `"column":["id","name","age"]`. If you want to write all columns in turn, use the \* representation, for example, `"column ": ["*"]`.|Yes|None |
|preSql|The SQL statement that runs before the data synchronization task run. Currently, you can run only one SQL statement in wizard mode, and multiple SQL statements in script mode. For example, clear old data.|No|None |
|postSql|The SQL statement that runs after the data synchronization task run. Currently, you can run only one SQL statement in wizard mode, and more than one SQL statement in script mode. For example, add a timestamp.|No|None |
|writeMode|Specifies the import mode. Data can be inserted.insert: If the primary key conflicts with the unique index, Data Integration deems the data as dirty data, but the original data is retained.

|No|Insert|
|batchSize|The number of records submitted in batch at a time can greatly reduce interactions between Data Integration and SQL Server over the network, and increase the overall throughput. However, an excessively large value may cause the running process of Data Integration to become Out of Memory \(OOM\).|No|1,024|

## Development in wizard mode {#section_bp2_wsh_p2b .section}

1.  Choose source

    Configuration item descriptions:

    ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/16255/15502187468218_en-US.png)

    Parameters:

    -   Data source: The datasource in the preceding parameter description. Enter the data source name you configured.
    -   Table: The table in the preceding parameter description. Select the table for synchronization.
    -   Prepared statement before import: The preSQL in the preceding parameter description, namely, the SQL statement that runs before the data synchronization task run.
    -   Post-import completion statement: The postSQL in the preceding parameter description, which is the SQL statement that runs after the data synchronization task run.
    -   Primary key conflict: The writeMode in the preceding parameter description. You can select the expected import mode.
2.  The field mapping which is the column in the above parameter description.

    The source table field on the left and the target table field on the right are one-to-one relationships, click Add row to **add a single** field and click **Delete** to delete the current field.

    -   In-row mapping: You can click **Enable Same-Line Mapping** to create a mapping for the same row. Note that the data type must be consistent.
    -   Automatic formatting: The fields are automatically sorted based on corresponding rules.
3.  Control the tunnel

    Parameters:

    -   DMU: A unit which measures the resources consumed during data integration, including CPU, memory, and network bandwidth. One DMU represents the minimum amount of resources used for a data synchronization task.
    -   Concurrent job count: The maximum number of threads used to concurrently read/write data into the data storage media in a data synchronization task. In wizard mode, configure a concurrency for the specified task on the wizard page.
    -   The maximum number of errors indicates the maximum number of dirty data records.
    -   Task resource group: The machine on which the task runs./ If the number of tasks is large, the default Resource Group is used to wait for a resource. We recommend that you add a Custom Resource Group \(currently only East China 1 and East China 2 supports adding custom resource groups\). For more information, see [Add scheduling resources](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Data integration/Common Configuration/Add task resources.md#).

## Development in script mode {#section_cp2_wsh_p2b .section}

Configure jobs written to SQL Server, see parameter descriptions for specific parameter completion.
