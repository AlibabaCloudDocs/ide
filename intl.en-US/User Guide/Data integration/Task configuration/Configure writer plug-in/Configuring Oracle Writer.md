# Configuring Oracle Writer {#concept_dzy_j2n_q2b .concept}

This topic describes the data types and parameters supported by Oracle Writer and how to configure Writer in both Wizard and Script mode.

The Oracle Writer plug-in provides the capability to write data into the target tables of the primary Oracle database. At the underlying implementation level, Oracle Writer connects to a remote Oracle database through JDBC, and runs the `insert into...` SQL statement to write data into the Oracle database. 

**Note:** You must configure the data source before configuring the Oracle Writer plug-in. For more information, see[Configure Oracle data source](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Data integration/Data source configuration/Configure Oracle data source.md#).

Oracle Writer is designed for Extract, transform, load \(ETL\) developers to import data from data warehouses to Oracle. Oracle Writer can also be used as a data migration tool by Database Administrator \(DBA\) and other users.

Oracle Writer uses the data synchronization framework to obtain protocol data generated by the Oracle Reader. Then it connects to a remote Oracle database through JDBC, and runs the insert into... The SQL statement to write data into Oracle.

## Type conversion list {#section_h4p_w2n_q2b .section}

Oracle Writer currently supports most Oracle data types. Check whether your data type is supported.

Oracle Writer converts the data types in Oracle as follows:

|Type classification|Oracle data type|
|:------------------|:---------------|
|Integer|NUMBER, RAWID, INTEGER, INT, and SMALLINT|
|Floating point|NUMERIC, DECIMAL, FLOAT, DOUBLE PRECISION, and REAL|
|String|LONG, CHAR, NCHAR, VARCHAR, VARCHAR2, NVARCHAR2, CLOB, NCLOB, CHARACTER, CHARACTER VARYING, CHAR VARYING, NATIONAL CHARACTER, NATIONAL CHAR, NATIONAL CHARACTER VARYING, NATIONAL CHAR VARYING, and NCHAR VARYING|
|TIMESTAMP and DATE|Timestamp and date|
|Boolean|BIT and BOOL|
|Binary|BLOB, BFILE, RAW, and LONG RAW|

## Parameter description​ {#section_jn2_gqh_p2b .section}

|Attribute|Description|Required|Default value|
|:--------|:----------|:-------|:------------|
|datasource|The data source name. The name must be identical to the added data source name. Adding data source is supported in script mode.|Yes|None|
|table|The target table name. If the table schema information is inconsistent with the user name in the preceding configuration, enter the table information in schematable format.|Yes|N/A|
|column|The required target table fields into which data is written, where each field is separated by commas \(,\). For example:`"column": ["id”,”name”,”age”]`.  Use asterisks \(\*\) to write data into all columns in sequence. For example: `"column":["*"]`.|Yes|None|
|preSql|The SQL statement that runs before running the data synchronization task. Currently, you can run only one SQL statement in Wizard Mode, and multiple SQL statement in Script Mode. For example: Clear old data.|No|None|
|postSql|The SQL statement that runs after running the data synchronization task. Currently, you can run only one SQL statement in Wizard Mode, and multiple SQL statement in Script Mode. For example: Add a timestamp.|No|None|
|batchSize|The number of records submitted in a single operation. Setting this parameter can greatly reduce interactions between CDP and Oracle over the network, and increase the overall throughput. However, an excessively large value may cause the running process of CDP to become Out of Memory \(OOM\).|No|1,024|

## Development in wizard mode {#section_bp2_wsh_p2b .section}

1.  Choose source

    The following are configuration item descriptions:

    ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/16251/15514335008194_en-US.png)

    Parameters:

    -   Data source: The datasource from the preceding parameter description. Enter the configured data source name .
    -   Table: The table in the preceding parameter description. Select the table for synchronization.
    -   Prepared statement before import: The preSQL parameter in the preceding parameter description. The SQL statement that is run before running the data synchronization task.
    -   Post-import completion statement: postSQL in the preceding parameter description, which is the SQL statement that runs after running the data synchronization task.
    -   Primary key conflict: writeMode in the preceding parameter description. You can select the expected import mode.
2.  Field mapping: The column in the preceding parameter description.

    The Source Table Field on the left maps with the Target Table Field on the right. To add a field, click **Add Line**, . To delete the line, move the cursor over a line and click **Delete**.

    -   In-row mapping: You can click **Enable Same-Line Mapping** to create a mapping for the same row. Note that the data type must be consistent.
    -   Automatic formatting: The fields are automatically sorted based on corresponding rules.
3.  Channel control

    Parameters:

    -   DMU: A unit measures the resources consumed during data integration, including CPU, memory, and network bandwidth. One DMU represents the minimum amount of resources used for a data synchronization task.
    -   Concurrent job count: The maximum number of threads used to concurrently read/write data into the data storage media in a data synchronization task. In Wizard Mode, configure a concurrency for the specified task on wizard page.
    -   The maximum number of errors indicates the maximum number of dirty data records.
    -   Task resource group: The machine on which the task runs. If the number of tasks is large, the default Resource Group is used to wait for a resource We recommend you add a Custom Resource Group \(currently only East China 1 and East China 2 supports adding custom resource groups\). For more information, see[Add task resources](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Data integration/Common configuration/Add task resources.md#).

## Development in script mode {#section_cp2_wsh_p2b .section}

Configure a job to write data into Oracle:

```
{
    "type":"job",
    "version": 2.0", // version number
    "steps":[
        {//The following is a reader template. You can find the corresponding reader plug-in documentations.

            "parameter":{},
            "name":"Reader",
            "category":"reader"
        },
        {
            "stepType": "oracle", // plug-in name
            "parameter": {
                "postSql": [], // SQL statement executed after the data synchronization task is executed

                "session": [], // database connection session parameters
                "column": [// Field
                    "id",
                    "name"
                ],
                "encoding": "UTF-8", // encoding format
                "batchSize": "1024", // number of records submitted in one batch size
                "table":"", // table name
                "postSql": []// SQL statement executed after the data synchronization task is executed
            },
            "name":"Writer",
            "category":"writer"
        }
    ],
    "setting":{
        "errorLimit":{
            "record": "0"//Number of error records
        },
        "speed":{
            "throttle":false,//False indicates that the traffic is not throttled and the following throttling speed is invalid. True indicates that the traffic is throttled.
            "concurrent": "1", //Number of concurrency
            "dmu": 1 //DMU Value
        }
    },
    "order":{
        "hops":[
            {
                "from":"Reader",
