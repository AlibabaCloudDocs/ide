# Quick start {#concept_wbz_jmv_q2b .concept}

Data Integration provides data acquisition capabilities for client Apps and webpages, including HTML5 page to meet your data tracking and user behavior data collection requirements.

You can simultaneously synchronize the user behavior data collected from clients to Alibaba Cloud [MaxCompute](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/zh/product/27797.htm)in real time for personalized analysis or collected behavior data mining.

**Note:** Currently, only East China 2 supports this feature.

## Create new application {#section_t4j_tmv_q2b .section}

1.  Set the application basic information.

    Select the client type and customize the application name and industry.

2.  The following steps are for configuring the data synchronization task.

    First, enter the Alibaba Cloud AccessKey information, and enter the synchronization target address . Currently, you can only synchronize data to MaxCompute. \(You need to activate MaxCompute and create a project.\)

    After selecting the created MaxCompute project name, enter a new custom data table name.

    **Note:** Enter a new table name for created tables without names, the new table will be automatically created during the synchronization process.

3.  The application is created successfully.

    After creating the application , the Appkey and secret are displayed, and the SDK address and integration guide documentation are downloaded.


## Manage applications {#section_k2z_vnv_q2b .section}

After creating an application, the system automatically goes to the **Application List** page. Where you can manage created applications, including delete applications, view application data synchronization status, and configure \(disabling, enabling, or editing\) data synchronization.

1.  Activate data synchronization.

    The configuration content process is similar to that of creating an application, where you can view the data synchronization status after it is activated.

    If a prompt is in sync, the data synchronization progress is in real time. You can view the latest synchronization data of the data table by going to the [MaxCompute console](https://account.alibabacloud.com/login/login.htm).

2.  Edit data synchronization.

    The edit items are the same as that of enable data synchronization. After editing, the target data source for data synchronization is updated in real time.

3.  Stops data synchronization.

    You can disable data synchronization to stop synchronizing data from an application to MaxCompute. Synchronized historical data remains unaffected after data synchronization stops.
