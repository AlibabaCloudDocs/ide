    Configurations:

    -   Name: The name must start with a letter or underscore \(\_\), and cannot exceed 60 characters in length. It can contain letters, numbers, and underscores \(\_\).
    -   Description: A brief description of the data source that does not exceed 80 characters in length.
    -   JDBC URL: The JDBC URL format is: jdbc:mysql://serverIP:Port/database.
    -   Username and password: The user name and password used for database connection.
6.  Click **Test Connectivity**
7.  When the connectivity has passed the test, click **Complete**.

    The DRDS data source provides test connectivity capability for verifying the entered information validity.


## Connectivity test description {#section_rrz_yc1_p2b .section}

-   The connectivity test is available in the classic network environment to identify whether the entered JDBC URL, user name, and password are valid.
-   Currently, the private network or IP addresses without public network, and data source connectivity tests are not supported. Click **OK**.
