This module will guide you through a complete data development and operations operation.

**Note:** If you are using DataWorks for the first time, make sure that you have already done the work based on the [preparation](../../../../intl.en-US/Preparation/Administrator operations/New user guide.md#) module, prepare accounts, project roles, project space, and so on, then enter the DataWorks Management Console, start the data development operation by clicking **enter workspace** after the corresponding project.

Typically, data development and operations through the project space of DataWorks include the following actions:

-   [Step two: Create a Business Process](intl.en-US/Quick Start/Step two: Create a Business Process.md#)
-   [Step 3: Create synchronization tasks](intl.en-US/Quick Start/Step 3: Create a synchronization task.md#)
-   [Step 4: Set cycles and dependencies](intl.en-US/Quick Start/Step 4: Scheduling and dependence settings.md#)
-   [Step 5: Operation and log delivery errors](intl.en-US/Quick Start/Step 5: O&amp;M and view log troubleshooting results.md#)
