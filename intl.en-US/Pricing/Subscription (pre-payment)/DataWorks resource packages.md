# DataWorks resource packages {#concept_265341 .concept}

DataWorks provides the resource packages of shared resource groups for scheduling, shared resource groups for Data Integration instances, and App Studio development environments. You can use these resource packages to lower your costs.

If your number of instances scheduled each day reaches a certain level and you can maintain steady growth, consider purchasing the resource packages of shared resource groups and shared resource groups for Data Integration instances. This provides you with the best price.

If you need to debug code frequently in App Studio, you can choose the resource package for App Studio development environments. This provides you with the lowest price per unit of time.

**Note:** Currently, this resource package does not support the renewal function. Pay attention to the resource package expiration date and expiration reminders \(through SMS or email\), and renew it before it expires. Otherwise, the account balance is deducted in pay-as-you-go mode after the package expires, resulting in increased business costs.

## Resource package of shared resource groups {#section_6km_31o_lss .section}

If your number of instances scheduled each day reaches a certain level and you can maintain steady growth but shared resource groups cannot give you the lowest costs, consider purchasing a resource package of shared resource groups to support the running of scheduled instances.

-   Billing range

    All instances of any type that are generated by nodes and submitted to the scheduling system are included in the billing range. This includes automatically triggered instances, manually triggered instances, test instances, and retroactive instances.

-   Billing standard

    Since the start of the trial operation of DataWorks on June 4, 2019, all users who have activated DataWorks can enjoy a 0% discount for 30 days. After July 2019, users can enjoy a 35% discount for purchasing resource packages.

    |Region|Billing standard|Description|
    |------|----------------|-----------|
    |China \(Shanghai\), China \(Hangzhou\), China \(Beijing\), China \(Shenzhen\), China\(Hong Kong\)|Resource package type|1,500,000 instances/month|
    |Duration|Starting from 6 months|
    |Minimum quantity|Starting from 1|
    |Price per resource package|14,790 USD/6 months 29,580 USD/year

 |
    |US \(Silicon Valley\), US \(Virginia\), Singapore, Australia \(Sydney\), Malaysia \(Kuala Lumpur\), Indonesia \(Jakarta\), India \(Mumbai\), Japan \(Tokyo\), Germany \(Frankfurt\), UK \(London\), UAE \(Dubai\)|Resource package type|1,500,000 instances/month|
    |Duration|Starting from 6 months|
    |Minimum quantity|Starting from 1|
    |Price per resource package|21,378 USD/6 months 42,756 USD/year

 |

    **Note:** Instances that run in the current month only consume the instance quota of the resource package of the same month \(the monthly instance quota for a single resource package cannot exceed 1,500,000 instances\). The instance quota is restored at the start of the next month. Unused quota does not roll over to the next month.

    -   Example 1: If you purchase the 6-month resource package and only use 1,200,000 instances in the first month, you have a remaining quota of 300,000 instances. If you do not use these instances by the end of the first month, the remaining quota from the first month does not roll over to the second month, and the instance quota for the second month is still 1,500,000 instances.
    -   Example 2: If you purchase the 6-month resource package and your quota for the first month is 1,500,000 instances, any instances in excess of the quota are billed according to the billing standard of shared resource groups.
-   Deduction method

    Resource packages are paid for by subscription. You can start using a resource package after paying the full subscription fee during a given service period. After you purchase a resource package, all instances that run successfully are deducted from the resource package quota first.

    This resource package includes a quota of instances that can be scheduled. When you schedule instances, the resource package is used up first.

-   Expiration

    After a resource package expires, you are given a 15-day grace period. During the 15 days, the quota in the resource package can still be used to offset the usage of pay-as-you-go items in the shared resource group.

    After 15 days, the unused quota in the resource package becomes unavailable. If you want to continue using the resources by resource package, you must purchase another resource package.


## Resource package of shared resource groups for Data Integration instances {#section_gzr_m89_f1m .section}

If your number of concurrent instances scheduled each day reaches a certain level and you can maintain steady growth but shared resource groups for Data Integration instances cannot give you the lowest costs, consider purchasing a resource package of shared resource groups for Data Integration instances to support the running of scheduled instances.

-   Billing range

    Concurrent instances that are generated when Data Integration nodes run in automatically triggered instances, retroactive instances, manually triggered instances, DataStudio workflow, or smoke testing mode.

-   Billing standard

    |Region|Billing standard|Description|
    |------|----------------|-----------|
    |China \(Shanghai\), China \(Hangzhou\), China \(Beijing\), China \(Shenzhen\), China\(Hong Kong\)|Resource package type|1,500,000 concurrent instances/month|
    |Duration|Starting from 6 months|
    |Minimum quantity|Starting from 1|
    |Price per resource package|1,044 USD/6 months 2,088 USD/year

    **Note:** The concurrent instances that are run in the current month only consume the concurrent instance quota of the resource package of the same month \(the monthly concurrent instance quota for a single resource package cannot exceed 1,500,000 instances\). The concurrent instance quota is restored at the start of the next month. The unused quota does not roll over to the next month.

    -   Example 1: If you purchase the 6-month resource package and only use 1,200,000 concurrent instances in the first month, you have a remaining quota of 300,000 concurrent instances. If you do not use these instances by the end of the first month, the remaining quota from the first month does not roll over to the second month, and the concurrent instance quota for the second month is still 1,500,000 instances.
    -   Example 2: If you purchase the 6-month resource package and your quota for the first month is 1,500,000 concurrent instances, any concurrent instances in excess of the quota are billed according to the billing standard of shared resource groups for Data Integration instances.
-   Deduction method

    Resource packages are paid for by subscription. You can start using a resource package after paying the full subscription fee during a given service period. After you purchase a resource package, all instances that run successfully are deducted from the resource package quota first.

    This resource package includes a quota of concurrent instances that can be used for running Data Integration nodes. When you schedule such nodes, the resource package is used up first.

-   Expiration

    After a resource package expires, you are given a 15-day grace period. During the 15 days, the quota in the resource package can still be used to offset the usage of pay-as-you-go items in the shared resource groups for Data Integration instances.

    After 15 days, the unused quota in the resource package becomes unavailable. If you want to continue using the resources by resource package, you must purchase another resource package.


## Resource package of App Studio development environments {#section_w4k_aew_oux .section}

-   Billing standard

    DataWorks provides resource packages for App Studio development environments, allowing you to debug code frequently. The billing standard is listed in the following table.

    |Resource package quota \(billable hours\)|Validity period|Price \(USD\)|Region|
    |-----------------------------------------|---------------|-------------|------|
    |100|1 year|7|China \(Shanghai\), China \(Hangzhou\), China \(Shenzhen\), China \(Beijing\)|

    The relationships between different types of App Studio development environments and consumed billable hours are listed in the following table.

    |App Studio development environment|Actual debugging time \(hours\)|Consumed billable hours|
    |----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|
    |1c2g|1|1|
    |2c4g|1|2|
    |4c8g|1|4|
    |8c16g|1|8|

-   Deduction method

    Each resource package is valid for one year. During this year, the debugging time first consumes billable hours in the resource package.

    **Note:** After you purchase a resource package, debugging first deducts the quota in the resource package. When the resource package is used up, the monthly free hours are calculated.

-   Expiration

    If the resource package quota is not used up during the year, the remaining quota expires and becomes unavailable.

    If the resource package quota is used up before the year ends, the billing system bills based on the billing standard \(pay-as-you-go\) of App Studio development environments.
