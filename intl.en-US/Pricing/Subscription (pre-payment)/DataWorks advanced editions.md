## Upgrade and renewal {#section_5kd_zvm_8zx .section}

-   Upgrade

    A lower-level advanced edition can be upgraded to a higher-level edition. In this case, you only pay the difference in price for the remaining portion of the billing cycle.

-   Renewal

    You can renew an advanced edition within the seven days before or after it expires. If you do not renew your advanced edition before it expires, its advanced functions are disabled and the advanced edition is downgraded to the Basic Edition. If you still do not renew your advanced edition within the seven days after it expires, the advanced edition is released seven days after expiration.


## Service suspension, downgrade, and release {#section_79o_395_dq6 .section}

-   Service suspension and downgrade

    By default, the billing system sends expiration warnings to your primary Alibaba Cloud account, mobile phone number, and email address seven days, three days, and one day before the your purchased advanced edition expires \(Standard, Professional, Enterprise, or Ultimate Edition\). If you do not renew your edition before it expires, the advanced features of the edition are immediately disabled and the edition is downgraded to the Basic Edition.

    For the specific function deactivation rules for each edition, see [Function downgrades of DataWorks advanced editions upon expiration](intl.en-US/Pricing/Appendix/Function downgrades of DataWorks advanced editions upon expiration.md#).
