## Billing methods {#section_907_uqm_3bz .section}

DataWorks provides two billing methods: Pay-As-You-Go \(post-payment\) and subscription \(pre-payment\).

-   Pay-As-You-Go \(post-payment\)

    Pay-As-You-Go bills you based on the actual volume used multiplied by the unit price. There are two billing cycles used for different billing items:

    -   Hourly billing: Every hour, the billing system calculates the actual volume used over the previous hour and deducts the amount from your account balance.

        For example, the billing system bills you at 9:30 for the charges produced from 08:00 to 09:00.

    -   Daily billing: At the beginning of each calendar day, the billing system calculates the actual volume used over the previous calendar day and deducts the actual consumption amount from your account balance.

        For example, the billing system bills you at 00:00:00 on May 12, 2019 for the charges produced from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59 on May 11, 2019.

-   Subscription \(pre-payment\)

    In the subscription method, you can use resources only after paying for them. Depending on the billing cycle, a subscription can be paid for a service on a monthly or yearly basis, or for a package without a validity period.
