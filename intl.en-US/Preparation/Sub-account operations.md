# Sub-account operations {#concept_btc_smp_r2b .concept}

If this is your first time to use DataWorks and to work on the DTplus platform with your sub-account, you must make sure that you are equipped with the following information:

-   The enterprise alias for the primary account to which your sub-account subordinates.
-   The user name and password of your sub-account.
-   The AccessKey ID and AccessKey Secret of your sub-account.
-   Confirm that the primary account has allowed your sub-account to **Enable Console Logon**.
-   Confirm that the primary account has allowed your sub-account to **Manage AccessKeys**.

If you are not sure about this information, verify the following with your primary account:
